When user is prompted for information about my application repository, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, and Questions When user enters their project title, then this is displayed as the title of the README. When user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing,. When user chooses a license, then a badge for the license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under, when I enter my GitHub username. 

I tired to upload my video to my readme but the video is to large to be put in the readme
